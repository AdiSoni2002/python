It is believed that the origin of the word "monument" comes from the Greek mnemosynon and the Latin moneo, monere, which means 'to remind', 'to advise' or 'to warn',[3] however, it is also believed that the word monument originates from an Albanian word 'mani men' which in Albanian language means 'remember', suggesting a monument allows us to see the past thus helping us visualize what is to come in the future.[4] In English the word "monumental" is often used in reference to something of extraordinary size and power, as in monumental sculpture, but also to mean simply anything made to commemorate the dead, as a funerary monument or other example of funerary art.
